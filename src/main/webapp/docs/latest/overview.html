<h2><a id="Introduction_11"></a>Introduction</h2>
<p>CarbonData is a fully indexed columnar and Hadoop native data-store for processing heavy analytical workloads and detailed queries on big data. CarbonData allows  faster interactive query using advanced columnar storage, index, compression and encoding techniques to improve computing efficiency, which helps in speeding up queries by an order of magnitude faster over PetaBytes of data.</p>
<p>In customer benchmarks, CarbonData has proven to manage Petabyte of data running on extraordinarily low-cost hardware and answers queries around 10 times faster than the current open source solutions (column-oriented SQL on Hadoop data-stores).</p>
<p>Some of the salient features of CarbonData are :</p>
<ul>
<li>Low-Latency for various types of data access patterns like Sequential, Random and OLAP.</li>
<li>Fast query on fast data.</li>
<li>Space efficiency.</li>
<li>General format available on Hadoop-ecosystem.</li>
</ul>
<div id="file-format"></div>
<h2><a id="CarbonData_File_Structure_23"></a>CarbonData File Structure</h2>
<p>CarbonData files contain groups of data called blocklets, along with all required information like schema, offsets and indices etc, in a file footer, co-located in HDFS. The file footer can be read once to build the indices in memory, which can be utilized for optimizing the scans and processing for all subsequent queries.</p>
<p>Each blocklet in the file is further divided into chunks of data called data chunks. Each data chunk is organized either in columnar format or row format, and stores the data of either a single column or a set of columns. All blocklets in a file contain the same number and type of data chunks.</p>

  </div>
<p>Each data chunk contains multiple groups of data called as pages. There are three types of pages.</p>
<ul>
<li>Data Page: Contains the encoded data of a column/group of columns.</li>
<li>Row ID Page (optional): Contains the row ID mappings used when the data page is stored as an inverted index.</li>
<li>RLE Page (optional): Contains additional metadata used when the data page is RLE coded.</li>
</ul>

<div id="features"></div>
<h2><a id="Features_40"></a>Features</h2>
<p>CarbonData file format is a columnar store in HDFS, it has many features that a modern columnar format has, such as splittable, compression schema, complex data type etc and CarbonData has following unique features:</p>
<ul>

<li><div id="Unique_Data_Organization">
	<b>Unique Data Organization</b>: Though CarbonData stores data in Columnar format, it differs from traditional Columnar formats as the columns in each row-group(Data Block) is sorted independent of the other columns. Though this arrangement requires CarbonData to store the row-number mapping against each column value, it makes it possible to use binary search for faster filtering and since the values are sorted, same/similar values come together which yields better compression and offsets the storage overhead required by the row number mapping.
</div>
</li>

<li>
<div id="Advanced_Push_Down_Optimizations">	
<b>Advanced Push Down Optimizations</b>: CarbonData pushes as much of query processing as possible close to the data to minimize the amount of data being read, processed, converted and transmitted/shuffled. Using projections and filters it reads only the required columns form the store and also reads only the rows that match the filter conditions provided in the query.
</div>
</li>

<li>
<div id="Multi_Level_Indexing">
<b>Multi Level Indexing</b>: CarbonData uses multiple indices at various levels to enable faster search and speed up query processing.
<ul>
<li>
Global Multi Dimensional Keys(MDK) based B+Tree Index for all non- measure columns: Aids in quickly locating the row groups(Data Blocks) that contain the data matching search/filter criteria.</li>
<li>
Min-Max Index for all columns: Aids in quickly locating the row groups(Data Blocks) that contain the data matching search/filter criteria.</li>
<li>
Data Block level Inverted Index for all columns: Aids in quickly locating the rows that contain the data matching search/filter criteria within a row group(Data Blocks).
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<div id="Dictionary_Encoding">
<b>Dictionary Encoding</b>: Most databases and big data SQL data stores employ columnar encoding to achieve data compression by storing small integers numbers (surrogate value) instead of full string values. However, almost all existing databases and data stores divide the data into row groups containing anywhere from few thousand to a million rows and employ dictionary encoding only within each row group. Hence, the same column value can have different surrogate values in different row groups. So, while reading the data, conversion from surrogate value to actual value needs to be done immediately after the data is read from the disk. But CarbonData employs global surrogate key which means that a common dictionary is maintained for the full store on one machine/node. So CarbonData can perform all the query processing work such as grouping/aggregation, sorting etc on light weight surrogate values. The conversion from surrogate to actual values needs to be done only on the final result. This procedure improves performance on two aspects.	
Conversion from surrogate values to actual values is done only for the final result rows which are much less than the actual rows read from the store.
All query processing and computation such as grouping/aggregation, sorting, and so on is done on lightweight surrogate values which requires less memory and CPU time compared to actual values.

<div id="Update_Delete_Support">
	<b>Update Delete Support</b>: It supports batch updates like daily update scenarios for OLAP and Base+Delta file based design.
	</div>
</li>
<li>
<div id="Deep_Spark_Integgration">
	<b>Deep Spark Integration</b>: It has built-in spark integration for Spark 1.5, 1.6 and interfaces for Spark SQL, DataFrame API and query optimization. It supports bulk data ingestion and allows saving of spark dataframes as CarbonData files.
	</div>
</li>
<li><b>Store data along with index</b>: Significantly accelerates query performance and reduces the I/O scans and CPU resources when there are filters in the query. CarbonData index consists of multiple levels of indices. A processing framework can leverage this index to reduce the task it needs to schedule and process. It can also do skip scan in more finer grain units (called blocklet) in task side scanning instead of scanning the whole file.</li>
<li><b>Operable encoded data</b>: By supporting efficient compression and global encoding schemes, it can query on compressed/encoded data, the data can be converted just before returning the results to the users, which is “late materialized”.</li>
<li><b>Column group</b>: Allows multiple columns to form a column group that would be stored as row format. This reduces the row reconstruction cost at query time.</li>
<li><b>Supports for various use cases with one single Data format</b>: Examples are interactive OLAP-style query, Sequential Access (big scan), and Random Access (narrow scan).</li>

<h2><a id="Packaging_and_Interfaces_73"></a>Interfaces</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<h4><a id="API_90"></a>API</h4>
<p>CarbonData can be used in following scenarios:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>For MapReduce application user<br>
This User API is provided by carbon-hadoop. In this scenario, user can process CarbonData files in his MapReduce application by choosing CarbonInput/OutputFormat, and is responsible for using it correctly. Currently only CarbonInputFormat is provided and OutputFormat will be provided soon.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For Spark user<br>
This User API is provided by Spark itself. There are two levels of APIs</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>CarbonData File</strong></p>
<p>Similar to parquet, json, or other data source in Spark, CarbonData can be used with data source API. For example (please refer to DataFrameAPIExample for more detail):</p>
<pre><code>// User can create a DataFrame from any data source or transformation.
val df = ...

// Write data
// User can write a DataFrame to a CarbonData file
df.write
.format(&quot;carbondata&quot;)
.option(&quot;tableName&quot;, &quot;carbontable&quot;)
.mode(SaveMode.Overwrite)
.save()


// read CarbonData data by data source API
df = carbonContext.read
.format(&quot;carbondata&quot;)
.option(&quot;tableName&quot;, &quot;carbontable&quot;)
.load(&quot;/path&quot;)

// User can then use DataFrame for analysis
df.count
SVMWithSGD.train(df, numIterations)

// User can also register the DataFrame with a table name, and use SQL for analysis
df.registerTempTable(&quot;t1&quot;)  // register temporary table in SparkSQL catalog
df.registerHiveTable(&quot;t2&quot;)  // Or, use a implicit funtion to register to Hive metastore
sqlContext.sql(&quot;select count(*) from t1&quot;).show
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Managed CarbonData Table</strong></p>
<p>CarbonData has in built support for high level concept like Table, Database, and supports full data lifecycle management, instead of dealing with just files user can use CarbonData specific DDL to manipulate data in Table and Database level. Please refer <a href="https://github.com/HuaweiBigData/carbondata/wiki/Language-Manual:-DDL">DDL</a> and <a href="https://github.com/HuaweiBigData/carbondata/wiki/Language-Manual:-DML">DML</a>.</p>
<pre><code>// Use SQL to manage table and query data
create database db1;
use database db1;
show databases;
create table tbl1 using org.apache.carbondata.spark;
load data into table tlb1 path 'some_files';
select count(*) from tbl1;
</code></pre>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>For developer who want to integrate CarbonData into processing engines like spark, hive or flink, use API provided by carbon-hadoop and carbon-processing:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Query</strong> : Integrate carbon-hadoop with engine specific API, like spark data source API.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Data life cycle management</strong> : CarbonData provides utility functions in carbon-processing to manage data life cycle, like data loading, compact, retention, schema evolution. Developer can implement DDLs of their choice and leverage these utility function to do data life cycle management.</p>
</li>
</ul>
